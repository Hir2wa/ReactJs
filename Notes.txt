Functinal componect 
component in react in other words are functional componect because it using the function which is return jsx as html but under the hood these is the js dom " 
--they are like 3 ways we can style of component 
1.styled component
2.using inline styling 
3.creating file in js
but the purpose of creating is not creating scope is organizing
so for small project you can create nested codes but for big project not recomended 
React Hook 
⚠️ Rules of Hooks (React strictly enforces this)
✅ You can only use Hooks inside function components

✅ Always at the top level of the component (not inside if, for, etc.)

✅ Hooks must start with use



React List and Keys 
--------------------
React Prop and prop PropDrilling
---------------------------------
these is properties and propertiese are holding data and these 
and prop drilling allwo as to take that data down from parent component to child component 

| Concept           | What it means                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Prop**          | A way to send data from parent → child    |
| **Prop Drilling** | Sending props through too many components |
| **Problem**       | Messy, hard to maintain                   |
| **Fix**           | Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc          |
